### Welcome to the Explortron Example Repository!

This presentation will take you through some of the key features provided by the extension, so let's get started!

---

<section>
A first feature is the ability to show presentations, directly in VS Code right where your students are. 
</section>

<section>

Presentations are simply markdown files that are rendered as interactive presentations using `markdown.js`.

</section>

<section>

This has a couple of advantages:
</section>



<section>

- No special software is needed to edit the presentations
</section>


<section>

- The presentations can live directly in the repository and can even make use of source control so your presentations and code content are always in sync.
</section>

<section>

- The markdown files still make sense as plain text files even if the student does not have presentation software installed on their computer.
